## Value

A *value* is a piece of information that corresponds to a real data structure or a
component of a data structure.

A value is the result of parsing a [document](#document), [expression](#expression), [term](#expression)
or [argument](#tagged-value). There are seven value *variants*: [nil](#nil), [text](#text),
[compound](#compound), [dictionary](#dictionary), [table](#table), [tuple](#tuple)
and [tagged value](#tagged-value).
**Categorization:**
- Text represents a primitive or scalar value.
- Tagged values represent values with tags.
- A dictionaries, list or tuple represents a collection of values.
- Nil represents an empty (zero term) or null value. A compound represents a value with multiple terms.

### Text

Corresponds to a scalar, primitive, atomic or irreducible data structure, like
strings, numbers, decimals, booleans, dates. It consists of a string which is a
textual representation of the corresponding data structure.

### Tagged value

Corresponds to a data structure that has a tag attached. A tag could determine
some kind of type, classification or configuration of the data structure.

For example: Enum variant, placeholder, function name, parameterization name, markup tag |

Consists of a tag and another [value](#value).

data structure or command. A tagged value consists of a name, attributes and parameters.
A *name* is a string which identifies the tag. An *attribute* configures the tag
and is either *valued* or *empty*. An attribute is identified by a string, and a valued
attribute has a string value. Duplicate attributes are not allowed. A *parameter* is
a [value](#value) that is used to instantiate the data structure or command.
A tag name cannot start with a hash sign `#`, as this is reserved for [text block tags](#text-block).

### Tuple

A *tuple* is a [value](#value) corresponding to a heterogeneous collection which contains
zero, one or multiple values, called *elements*.

The *unit tuple*, the tuple with zero elements, represents a trivial or default instance.
Do not confuse this with [nil](#nil), which represents an empty instance.

A tuple with 1 element is always automatically unwrapped, unless the element is a
tuple itself. Thus, in general there is no way to distinguish between a value and
a tuple containing that value.

A tuple often has fixed length and heterogeneous elements.

Example: Tuple, arguments, parameters, components, substructures

### Dictionary

A *dictionary* corresponds to a collection of data structures organized by 
string keys. It consists of a sequence of key-value pairs known as
entries. An *entry* assigns a [*value*](#value) to a string *key*. Entries
with identical keys are not allowed.

Example: Dictionary, object, struct, configuration

### List

A *list* corresponds to a collection of (optionally, ordered) values. A list of
tuples all of which have the same number of elements is known as a *table*.

A list often has arbitrary length and homogeneous elements.

Example: Table, list, set, array, matrix, markup tabulation

### Compound

A *compound* is a [value](#value) corresponding to a "textual" composition of data
structures. It consists of a sequence of elements. An *element* is either a [value](#value)
or a space separator. Markup is the prime example of a data structure represented
by a compound.

For exmaple: Markup and customized syntax.

### Nil

*Nil* corresponds to an empty or null data structure.

## Syntax

### Value

```
<value> → <inner-value>
        | "|" <inner-value>
        | <tagged-value>
```

Represents an arbitrary [value](#value).

All values consist of [blocks](#block) which may be wrapped in
[tuple](#tuple-1) and [tagged value](#tagged-value-1) expressions.

Blocks and tuples are optionally prefixed by a bar `|`. This is recommended 
style for multiline tuples.

#### Inner value

```
<inner-value> → <block>
              | <tuple>
```

#### Block

```
<block> → <term>
        | <term> <block>
        | "~"
        | "~" <block>
```

Represents a [value](#value) depending on its terms.

Consists of a non-blank
sequence of [terms](#term), tildes `~` and optional whitespace in between them.

Tilde `~` is an operator which discards adjacent whitespace. *Discarded whitespace*
is ignored in compound expressions and text terms. A `~` can be placed before or
after all the terms, but will have no effect. A `~` can stand in for an empty expression,
since an expression cannot be blank.

An *empty block*, a block with zero terms, represents a [nil](#nil) value. A
block with one term is a *simple block*, and represents the same value as the
term.

A *simple expression* is an expression with a single term. It represents the [value](#value)
the term represents.

A *compound expression* is an expression with multiple terms. It represents a [compound](#compound).
The compound contains the structures represented by the terms, ordered accordingly.
If there is non-discarded whitespace between two terms, then there is a space between
the corresponding structures in the result.

#### Term

```
<term> → <text>
       | <bracketed-value>
       | <bracketed-dictionary>
       | <bracketed-list>
       | <tagged-arguments>
```

Represents a [value](#value) in a [block](#block).

A term may be one of the following: [text](#text),
[bracketed value](#bracketed-value), [bracketed dictionary](#bracketed-dictionary),
[bracketed list](#bracketed-list) or [tagged arguments](#tagged-arguments).

Some terms cannot be adjacent to each other, because they will merge. This is overcome
by using a [bracketed expression](#bracketed-expression) or sometimes a tilde `~` operator.

The following textual representations can be used as terms:

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `~` is an empty expression. It contains no terms and represents [nil](#nil).
- `Hello world!` is a text expression containing a text term.
- `Text constructed from 5 words.`
- `R ~ e ~ d` is equivalent to `Red`.
- `{k1: v1; k2: v2}` is a dictionary expression containing a dictionary term.
- `{k1: v1} Text [1; 2; 3]` is a compound expression containing a dictionary term,
  text term and table term. It represents a [compound](#compound).
- `{c1} ~ {c2}` is equivalent to `{c1}{c2}`, but not `{c1} {c2}`.
- `{c1}`, `~ {c1}`, `{c1} ~`, `~ {c1} ~` are equivalent.
- **Whitespace equivalence:**
  ```
  a
  b {c}d
  [e]~
  f
  ```
  is equivalent to `a b {c}d [e]f`, and
  ```
  Text    with    whitespace
  ```
  is equivalent to `Text with whitespace`.

</details>

##### Text

```
<text>  → <string>
        | <string> <text'>
<text'> → <string>
        | <string> <text'>
        | "~" <text'>
```

Represents [text](#text). Used as [term](#term).

Consists of a sequence of [words](#word), [transcriptions](#transcription),
[text blocks](#text-block) and tilde `~` operators which may have [whitespace](#whitespace)
in between them. When parsed, the strings represented by the [words](#word), [transcriptions](#transcription)
and [text blocks](#text-block) are concatenated. If there is non-discarded whitespace
in between two strings, then there is a space character between them in the result.
The concatenated string is the content of the represented text.

#### Tuple

```
<tuple> → <block> "|" <block>
        | <block> "|" <tuple>
```

Represents a [tuple](#tuple) with multiple elements.

In tuple expressions, [blocks](#block) are delimited by a bar `|`.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `<>:a:b:c:d` is a tuple with 4 parameters.
- `<>:{<>:{a}}`, `<>:{a}` and `a` are equivalent by automatic unwrapping.
- `a | b | c` is a tuple expression evaluating to a tuple with 3 elements.

</details>

#### Tagged value

```
<tagged-value> → <tag>":"_<value>
```

Represents a [tagged value](#tagged-value) or a [tuple](#tuple) if the tag is
and empty tag `<>`.

Consists of a
[tag](#tag) followed by a colon `:`, whitespace and finally a [value](#value-1).

#### Bracketed value

```
<bracketed-value> → "{" <value> "}"
```

Represents a [value](#value), namely the same value that it encloses.

Consists of a [value](#value) enclosed in a pair of curly brackets `{`, `}`.

Used as a [term](#term) and an [argument](#tagged-value).

Bracketing is sometimes necessary to delimit terms in an expression.
Some [terms](#expression), like a [text term](#expression) or a [tag term](#tagged-value)
could incorrectly merge with other terms when they are placed next to each other.

Bracketing could also be applied to increase readability, most commonly in multiline
contexts.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- An expression with the 2 terms `Purple` and `Orange` is correctly written `{Purple} {Orange}`.
  On the other hand, `Purple Orange` is an expression with a single text term.
- `{a [b; c]} d` is an expression with 2 terms. Without the curly brackets, this expression
  would have 3 terms.
- **Readability:**
  ```
  ...
  > content: {
    A paragraph...
  }
  ...
  ```

</details>

### Dictionary

```
<dictionary> → <delimited-dictionary>
             | <aligned-dictionary>
             | <absolute-dictionary>
```

Represents a [dictionary](#dictionary).

There are three dictionary notations: *delimited*, *aligned* and *absolute*.

#### Entry

```
<entry> → <key>":" <value>

<key> → <string>
      | <string>":"<key>
```

Represents an entry in a [dictionary](#dictionary).

Stores a string key and arbitrary [value](#value).

Consists of a string



An entry is represented by a key, followed by a colon `:`, followed by a value. A
*key* is a string represented by a [word](#word), [transcription](#transcription) or [text block](#text-block).
There cannot be any [whitespace](#whitespace) between a key and colon. A *value* is
a [value](#value) represented by an [expression](#expression). A nonempty
dictionary is represented by either of two notations: [flow notation](#flow-dictionary-notation)
or [bullet notation](#bullet-dictionary-notation). Flow notation is intended for inline
entries and compact representations, while bullet notation is intended for singleline
and multiline entries.

It is recommended to use kebab-case for keys.

#### Delimited dictionary notation

```
<delimited-dictionary> → <entry>
                       | <entry> ";"
                       | <entry> ";" <delimited-dictionary>
```

In *delimited notation*, entries are delimited by semicolons `;`. A *trailing semicolon*,
a semicolon following the last entry, is allowed.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- **Flow dictionary with 3 entries:** `k1: 1; "key 2": Hello world!; k3: [1; 2; 3]`
- **Flow dictionary & trailing semicolon:**
  ```
  k1: v1; k2: v2; k3: v3;

<bracketed-dictionary> → "{" "}"
                       | "{" <dictionary> "}"
```

Represents a dictionary. Consists of a dictionary enclosed in a pair of curly
brackets `{`, `}`. Can be used as an [argument](#argument) or
[term](#term). `{}` represents an empty dictionary.

### List

```
<list> → <delimited-list>
       | <aligned-list>
       | <tabular-list>
       | <tagged-list>
```

Represents a [list](#list) value.

An entry is represented by a [value](#value-1). A nonempty list is represented
by either of four notations: [delimited notation](#delimited-list-notation), [tabular notation](#tabular-list-notation), 
[aligned notation](#aligned-list-notation) or [tagged notation](#tagged-list-notation). Delimited notation is intended for inline
rows and compact representations, tabular notation is intended for singleline rows and
aligned notation is intended for multiline rows.

#### Delimited list notation

```
<delimited-list> → <value>
                 | <value> ";"
                 | <value> ";" <delimited-list>
```

In *delimited style* values are delimited by semicolons `;`. A trailing semicolon
is permitted.

```

A list bracket is a representation of a [list](#list-value) that can be used as
a term or argument.

A *bracketed table* is a table enclosed in a pair of square brackets `[`, `]`. It
can be used as a [term](#expression) or an [argument](#tagged-value). `[]` represents an
empty dictionary.

### Tagged arguments

```
<tagged-arguments> → <tag>
                   | <tag><arguments>

<arguments> → ":"<argument>
            | ":"<argument><arguments>

           | <bracketed-dictionary>
           | <bracketed-list>
           | <tagged-arguments>
```

Represents an arbitrary [value](#value).

An *argument* is a textual representation of a [value](#value) that can be
appended to a tuple or [tagged value](#tagged-value).

A *nil argument*, *text argument*, *dictionary argument*, *table argument*, *compound
argument* or *tag argument* is an argument evaluating to [nil](#nil), [text](#text),
a [dictionary](#dictionary), a [table](#table), a [compound](#compound), a tuple or a
[tag](#tagged-value) respectively.

The following textual representations can be used as components:

| Argument                                      | Represents                                       |

#### Composition

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `<bold>:<italic>:word` is equivalent to `<bold>:{ <italic>:word }`.
- `<a>:<b>:{c}:<d>:e:[f]` is equivalent to `<a>:{ <b>:{c}:{ <d>:e:[f] } }`.

</details>

### Tag

```
<tag> → "<"<word>">"
      | "<"<word>_<attributes> ">"
      | "<"">"

<attributes> → <attribute>
             | <attribute>_<attributes>

<attribute> → <word>
            | <word>":"<string>
```

A tagged value is represented by a tag, which contains the name and attributes, followed
by a sequence of arguments which represent the parameters. A *tag* is a left angle
bracket `<`, followed by a word which represents the name, followed by a sequence
of attributes, followed by a right angle bracket `>`. An empty attribute is represented
by a word, and a valued attribute is represented by a word, followed by a colon `:`,
followed by a [word](#word), [transcription](#transcription) or [text block](#text-block)
which represents the string attribute value. A parameter is represented by an appended
colon `:`, followed by the corresponding argument. There cannot be whitespace before
or between the colon `:` and argument.

It is recommended to use kebab-case for tag and attribute names.

### String

```
<string> → <word>
         | <transcription>
         | <text-block>
```

A *string* represents a sequence of characters.

#### Word

A *word* is a sequence of [glyphs](#glyph), including [character escape sequences](#character-escape-sequence)
and [repeated escape sequences](#repeated-escape-sequence). It represents a string.

#### Transcription

A *transcription* is a representation of a string. It is a sequence of characters
enclosed in a pair of backslashes `\ `. Reserved characters are allowed within the
transcription. It cannot span multiple lines. [Character escape sequences](#character-escape-sequence)
can be used within the transcription, whose primary use case is the insertion of backslashes
marks `\ ` or linebreaks.

The closing `\ ` can be omitted, in which case the transcription spans the rest of
the line.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `\This is a transcription\ `
- `\This transcription spans a line...`
- **Quotation with reserved characters & character escape sequences:**\
  ```\Reserved: {, }, [, ], <, >, :, ;, |, &, ~, ``, `\\ ``` yields the text string\
  `` Reserved: {, }, [, ], <, >, :, ;, |, &, ~, `, \ ``.

</details>

#### Text block

A *text block* is a sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of text block tags.
A text block represents a string. The *contents* of a text block is the enclosed characters,
excluding the tags.

A text block has a configuration which determines how its contents are processed.
By default, a text block is optimized for files (UNIX text files) and code.

A text block can have a [label](#labelled-text-block) which prevents content from
clashing with a closing block tag, but this is rarely needed.

##### Default text block

A text block is enclosed in a pair of text block tags `<#>`.

By default, the contents of a text block is formatted in 4 steps:
1. If a linebreak exists, delete the characters after the last linebreak if they are blank.
2. If a linebreak exists, delete the header line if it is blank.
3. Delete excess indentation from each line.

<summary>Examples</summary>

- **Code:**
  ```
  <#>
    def fib(n):
      if n == 0:
        return 0
      elif n == 1:
        return 1
      else:
        return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
  <#>
  ```
- **Stepwise formatting:**
  Let `·` represent a space character and `⏎` a newline character.
  ```
  ··<#>⏎
  ····def·sum(a,·b):⏎
  ······return·a·+·b⏎
  ··<#>⏎
  ```
  yields the string
  ```
  def·sum(a,·b):⏎
  ··return·a·+·b⏎
  ```
  Here, the characters after the last linebreak `··` are blank, and are deleted. The
  first line `⏎` is blank, and is deleted. The excess indentation `····` in each of
  the remaining lines is deleted.

##### Labelled text block

Text blocks may be labelled. Labels are rarely needed, but may in some cases to
prevent content from clashing with a tag.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- ```
  <#text>
    Text can contain <#> without
    clashing with the closing tag.
  <#text>
  ```
  is a text block with the label `text`.
- `<#khi><#a><#>...<#><#a><#khi>` yields the text `<#a><#>...<#><#a>`.

</details>

##### Configured text block

A text block can be configured. Its configuration determines how its contents are
formatted. A configuration is separated from the label by whitespace. The flags in
the configuration are applied in order.

| Flag | Function                                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `f`  | If a linebreak exists, delete the characters after the last linebreak if they are blank. |
| `h`  | If a linebreak exists, delete the header line if it is blank.                            |
| `x`  | Delete excess indentation from each line.                                                |
| `t`  | Delete trailing whitespace from each line.                                               |
| `l`  | Delete leading whitespace from each line.                                                |
| `n`  | Delete all linebreaks.                                                                   |
| `r`  | Clear configuration, including the defaults.                                             |

By default, a text block has the configuration `fhx`. The flag `r` resets and clears
all flags, including the default flags.

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `<#q n>Hello world!<#q>` is a text block with label `q`,
  and configuration `fhxn`.
- ```
  <# rtl>    public static final void main(String[] arguments) { ... }    <#>
  ```
  is a text block with configuration `tl`, and yields
  `public static final void main(String[] arguments) { ... }`.

### Characters

#### Whitespace

*Whitespace* is a sequence of [whitespace characters](#whitespace-character) or a [comment](#comment).

#### Glyph

A *glyph* is a character that is not a [whitespace character](#whitespace-character)
nor a [reserved character](#reserved-character).

#### Character escape sequence

A *character escape sequence* is a *backtick* `` ` ``, known as the *escape character*,
followed by one of a preset of characters. It represents a [glyph](#glyph).

| Sequence   | Glyph   |
|------------|---------|
| `` `: ``   | `:`     |
| `` `; ``   | `;`     |
| `` `\| ``  | `\|`    |
| `` `~ ``   | `~`     |
| ``` `` ``` | `` ` `` |
| `` `\ ``   | `\ `    |
| `` `{ ``   | `{`     |
| `` `} ``   | `}`     |
| `` `[ ``   | `[`     |
| `` `] ``   | `]`     |
| `` `< ``   | `<`     |
| `` `> ``   | `>`     |
| `` `# ``   | `#`     |
| `` `n ``   | Newline |
| `` `t ``   | Tab     |

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `` Example`: This is an example `` encodes the string `Example: This is an example`.

</details>

#### Repeated escape sequence

A *repeated escape sequence* is a sequence of characters that takes precedence over
the [reserved characters](#reserved-character) and represents a [glyph](#glyph).

| Sequence | Glyph |
|----------|-------|
| `::`     | `:`   |
| `;;`     | `;`   |
| `\|\|`   | `\|`  |
| `~~`     | `~`   |
| `<<`     | `<`   |
| `>>`     | `>`   |

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `a >> b` is [text](#text), but `a > b` is invalid since a single `>` is [reserved](#reserved-character).
- `Example:: This is an example` encodes the string `Example: This is an example`.

</details>

#### Whitespace character

A *whitespace character* is one of the following:
- `U+0020 (Space)`
- `U+0009 (Horizontal tabulation)`
- `U+000A (Line feed)`

#### Ignored character

An *ignored character* refers to `U+000D (Carriage return)`. It is always skipped,
even in [transcriptions](#transcription) and text blocks.

#### Reserved character

A *reserved character* is a character that does not represent [text](#text) in a word,
unless it is escaped in some way. Reserved characters add structure to the document.
Thus, they cannot be used freely as [glyphs](#glyph).

| Character | Name          | Use                                                        |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:`       | Colon         | Key-value separator, argument application, tuple delimiter |
| `;`       | Semicolon     | Row separator, entry delimiter                             |
| `\|`      | Bar           | Tuple separator                                            |
| `~`       | Tilde         | Whitespace contraction                                     |
| `` ` ``   | Backtick      | Escape sequence                                            |
| `\ `      | Backslash     | Begin transcription, end transcription                     |
| `{`       | Left bracket  | Begin expression, begin dictionary                         |
| `}`       | Right bracket | End expression, end dictionary                             |
| `[`       | Left square   | Begin table                                                |
| `]`       | Right square  | End table                                                  |
| `<`       | Left angle    | Begin tag, text block tag, diamond                         |
| `>`       | Right angle   | End tag, bullet                                            |

A hash `#` is not reserved, but either is text or opens a [comment](#comment) depending
on the character following it.

### Comment

A *comment* is a note to the editors of a document. It is considered to be whitespace
by the parser.

A comment is opened with a hash `#` which is followed by whitespace or another hash
`#`. The comment ends at the next linebreak or EOF. The comment may contain any sequence
of characters.

If the hash `#` is followed by another glyph, then the hash is considered to be a
regular text glyph. A hash `#` cannot be followed by
`:`, `;`, `|`, `~`, `\ `, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<` or `>`, unless the character is
part of a [repeated escape sequence](#repeated-escape-sequence).

<details>

<summary>Examples</summary>

- `# This is a comment` is a comment, because `#` is followed by whitespace.
- `#### Configuration ####` is a comment since the first `#` is followed
  by `#`.
- `#2`, `#0FA60F`, `A#B` and `#elements` are not comments since each `#`
  is followed by a text glyph.

## Document

```
<value-document> → *
                 | *<value>*

<dictionary-document> → *
                      | *<dictionary>*

<list-document> → *
                | *<list>*
```

A Khi document is any valid ASCII or Unicode character sequence conforming to
the rules of an [expression](#expression-syntax),
[dictionary](#dictionary-syntax) or [list](#list-syntax).

A *document* is a text file, string, stream, etc. conforming to either an [expression](#expression),
a [dictionary](#dictionary) or a [table](#table). It represents a [value](#value),
[dictionary](#dictionary) or a [table](#table) respectively. A blank document represents
[nil](#nil), an empty [dictionary](#dictionary) or an empty [table](#table).

## Media type & file extension

A generic Khi document file should have extension `khi`. Applications using Khi
files for specific should invent a more specific extension. For example, Khi encoded LaTeX could
have extension `tex.khi`.

A Khi expression document has media type `application/khi`, list
`application/khi-list` and dictionary `application/khi-dictionary`.
