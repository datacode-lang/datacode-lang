# Khi

- is a simple and universal textual data format and notation ([metaformat](https://www.w3.org/standards/webarch/metaformats)).
- can be used for configuration, markup, serialization, storage and interchange.
- has native support for the universal data structures commonly found in programming
  languages and other data formats like JSON, XML, CSV and LaTeX: text and markup,
  dictionaries, tables, lists, tuples, commands(LaTeX commands) and named hierarchies(XML tags/elements).
- is easy and intuitive to read, write and edit.

## Examples & showcase

The following are some examples of **Khi**-based formats and documents written in
them. The universality of the format is demonstrated: it is shown that Khi natively
can encode the same data structures as JSON, XML, CSV and (regular) LaTeX, and it
is shown that Khi allows these data structures to coexist within the same document,
unlike the other formats each of which only supports a subset of the universal data
structures.

### Wiki article example

This is an example of an article written in a **Khi**-based article format.

Such an article consists of significantly different kinds of data structures. It consists
of both structured data, such as values, dictionaries and lists, and unstructured
data, such as markup.

The purpose of this example is to show the capabilities of **Khi** when it is used
to its full extent. In particular, a wiki article usually contains both structured
data and unstructured data. Thus, this is a good example of how **Khi** can compose
both types into more complex hierarchical structures.

Additionally, this example showcases the **Khi** syntax. The readability, conciseness
and simplicity of the format should be compared to other formats encoding the same
data.

Notes:
- Command expressions look like this: `<cmd>:arg:arg:arg:arg`. Command arguments are
  appended with a colon.
- The `@` command inserts a link. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the
  article to link to, and the second is the link label that will appear in the article.
- The root element is a dictionary.

### HTML preprocessor example

This is an example of a document written in a **Khi**-based **HTML** preprocessor
input format. The preprocessor can compile this document to **HTML**.

The purpose of this example is to showcase a **Khi**-based encoding of markup and
**XML**-like structures.

Compare this document to the corresponding **HTML** document. In terms of verbosity
and syntax noise, **Khi** allows short and long closing tags. Both are useful in different
cases. **Khi** does not require quotes around attribute values.

Notes:
- The `<@doctype>:html` macro expression compiles to `<!doctype html>`.
- `<#>` opens and closes a multiline quote. Such a multiline quote discards any excess
  indentation.

```
<@doctype>:html # Preprocessor directive which inserts <!doctype html>.
<html>:{
  <head>:{
    <title>:{Hello world!}
    <script src:script.js>:{~} # {~} is an empty expression.
  }
  <body>:{
    <h1 id:main-heading>:{Hello world!}
    <p>:{Hello world!}
    <img src:frontpage.jpg>
    <div class:dark-background><><p>:{
      This is a paragraph <br>
      with a line break.
      <em class:italic>:{This text is italic.}
    }
    <pre>:<>:<code>:<>:<@raw>:<#>
      def fib(n):
          if n == 0:
              return 0
          elif n == 1:
              return 1
          else:
              return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

      print(fib(10))
      print(fib(20))
      print(fib(30))
    <#>
  }
}
```

### TeX preprocessor example

This is an example of a document written in a Khi-based **LaTeX** preprocessor
input format. The preprocessor can compile this document to **LaTeX**.

The purpose of this example is to show how Khi could encode **LaTeX**-like markup,
which involves handling hierarchies of text and commands.

Compare this document to the corresponding **LaTeX** document. They are similar, but
one benefit of the **Khi** document is that the arguments applied to a command can
be determined from syntax alone.

This format could be used to encode **LaTeX**-math, that is later displayed by **MathJax**.

Notes:
- `<n>` inserts a newline.
- Preprocessor macros start with `@`. They are processed by the preprocessor rather
  than TeX.
- Tables are compiled to tabulation syntax. For example, `[1|0; 0|1]` is compiled
  to `1&0\\0&1\\`.

### Material configuration example

This is an example of a Khi-based configuration format.

The purpose of this example is to show that Khi can encode the same structures as
JSON or YAML.

```
oak-planks: {
  name: Oak planks;
  description: Planks made from oak wood.;
  tags: [wood];
  price: 200;
};
birch-planks: {
  name: Birch planks;
  description: Planks made from birch wood.;
  tags: [wood];
  price: 200;
};
stone: {
  name: Stone;
  description: A solid material, but does not insulate well.;
  price: 100;
  tags: [heavy; stone];
};
marble: {
  name: Marble;
  price: 800;
  beauty: 2;
  tags: [heavy; stone; rich];
};
glass: {
  description; ~; # A single ~ indicates an empty description.
  name: Glass;
  price: 250;
};
```
