# Khi

- is a textual data format.
- has native support for the universal data structures found in modern programming
  languages and data formats like JSON, YAML, XML, CSV and LaTeX:
  - text and markup.
  - dictionaries.
  - tables, lists, tuples, matrices.
  - named hierarchies (like XML tags/elements).
  - functions, commands (like LaTeX commands).
- can be used for configuration, markup, storage and serialization.
- is intuitive to read, write and edit.
- is aesthetic and convenient for handcoding.
- is simple; There are no complex rules.
- is concise and has low syntax noise.

## A brief overview

### Document

A Khi document contains either an expression(a value), a dictionary or a table. It
is up to the programmer to decide which root element is most suitable. Possible values,
dictionaries and tables will be explained further below.

### Nil

Nil represents an empty or default value. It corresponds to other formats' null value.
A nil value is written `~`.

### Text

Text represents scalar or irreducible values like strings, numbers, booleans, dates etc. Simply
write `This is a string`, `300`, `1024.0`, `true`.
If the text contains reserved characters, you can optionally use quotes:
`"https://khilang.github.io/khi-editor/"`.

### Dictionary

A dictionary organizes values by string keys.

There are two notations for dictionaries:
- **Flow notation:**
  ```
  {name: Oak planks; price: 200}
  ```
- **Bullet notation:**
  ```
  {
    > name: Oak planks
    > price: 200
  }
  ```

It is recommended to use flow notation for inline entries and bullet notation for
multiline entries.

<details>
<summary>Non-recommended styles</summary>
The following syntax is allowed, but it is recommended to use bullet notation:

```
{
  name: Oak planks;
  price: 200;
}
```

The following is allowed, but looks bad:

```
{>name: Oak planks >price: 200}
```

</details>

### Table

A table organizes values by rows and columns. A table with one column is also known
as a list, and a table with one row is also known as a tuple.

There are three notations for tables:
- **Flow notation:**
  ```
  [1|0|0; 0|1|0; 0|0|1]
  ```
- **Grid notation:**
  ```
  [
    |1|~|~|
    |~|1|~|
    |~|~|1|
  ]
  ```
- **Bullet notation:**
  ```
  [
    > Northwest
    | Northeast
    > Southwest
    | Southeast
  ]
  ```

It is recommended to use flow notation for inline rows, grid notation for singleline
rows and bullet notation for multiline rows.

### Tuple

TODO: Write

A tuple is a parameterization of a data structure.

Tuples can be used to specify a data structure consisting of an arbitrary number of
components. It is recommended to only use tuples for obvious/well documented cases.
Complex structures should use a dictionary.

Tuples with 1 component are automatically unwrapped. Thus, `<>:a` will always be
unwrapped to `a`. (Unless `a` is a tuple, in which case the tuples become nested).

`<>:a:b:c:d` is a tuple with 4 parameters.

A tuple expression: `a :: b :: c` is an expression representing a tuple with 3 parameters.

### Tag / Tagged value

A tag is an identifier which can be attached to another value, or not. For example:

- **Enums:**
  `<Red>`, `<Blue>`, `<Green>`, `<Rgb>:255:127:0`. The first three are attached to
  an empty tuple, because they only have 1 possible value. The last is attached to a tuple with
  3 components.
- **Actions:**
  `<set>:x:10`, `<load>:std.lib`
- **LaTeX-like commands:**
  `<frac>:1:2`, `<begin>:bmatrix`
- **XML-like tagged trees**
  `<div class:m1>:{Content}` - patterns can have attributes which configure them.

### Composition

Whenever a value is expected, you can use one of the constructs above: nil, text,
dictionary, table, tuple and pattern. But you are also allowed to compose them. This is how
Khi supports markup; Markup consists of such textual compositions.

`This is a <br> composition` is a composition consisting of a text term, followed
by a pattern term, followed by a text term.

### Other features

These features have not been explained here:

- Text blocks: another way to represent text. Can be used to insert code or other
  files.
- Constructor notation
- Comments

## Examples & showcase

The following are some examples of **Khi** documents. It is shown how **Khi** supports
data structures native to configuration, markup and storage.

### Encyclopedia article example

This is an encyclopedia article example. It demonstrates that a **Khi** document can
contain both structured data, such as values, dictionaries and lists, and unstructured
data, such as markup.

Notes:
- Comments are opened by a hash `#`.
- This encyclopedia has macros. They are represented by Khi patterns: `<macro>:arg:arg:arg`.
- The `<@>` macro inserts a link. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the
  article to link to, and the second is the link label that will appear in the article.
- Compare: The `title` entry has a text value, while the `decsription` entry has a composition value.
- This is a dictionary document.

### Khi-encoded HTML example

This is a markup example. It demonstrates that **Khi**, like **XML**/**HTML**, natively
supports named hierarchies, including text and tags with attributes. A preprocessor
could compile this document to **HTML**.

Notes:
- Here, we distinguish between HTML tags and HTML preprocessor macros. Both are
  represented by Khi patterns, but a macro ends with `!`, while a regular HTML tag is
  alphabetic.
- `<doctype!>:html` compiles to `<!doctype html>`.
- `<#>` opens and closes a text block. We use it to embed code.
- This is an expression document.

```
# A frontpage

<doctype!>:html # Macro that inserts <!doctype html>.
<html>:{
  <head>:{
    <title>:{Hello world!}
    <script src:script.js>:{~} # {~} denotes an empty element.
  }
  <body>:{
    <h1 id:main-heading>:{Hello world!}
    <p>:{Hello world!}
    <img src:frontpage.jpg>
    <div class:dark-background>:<>:<p>:{
      This is a paragraph <br>
      with a line break.
      <em class:italic>:{This text is italic.}
    }
    <pre>:<>:<code>:<>:<raw!>:<#>
      def fib(n):
          if n == 0:
              return 0
          elif n == 1:
              return 1
          else:
              return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    <#>
  }
}
```

### Khi-encoded LaTeX example

This is a markup example. It demonstrates that **Khi**, like **LaTeX**, natively supports
compositions of text and commands with arguments. A preprocessor could compile this
document to **LaTeX**.

Notes:
- Here, we distinguish between regular LaTeX commands and preprocessor macros. Both
  are represented by Khi patterns, but a macro ends with `!`.
- **Khi** does not natively support optional arguments. This is instead handled by
  ending a command name with an apostrophe.
- Tables are compiled to tabulation syntax. For example, `[1|0; 0|1]` is compiled
  to **LaTeX** `1&0\\0&1\\`.
- This is an expression document.

```

### Material configuration example

This is a configuration example. It demonstrates that **Khi**, like **JSON** and **YAML**,
natively supports objects, arrays and scalar values.

Notes:
- **Khi** is not *syntax typed*, unlike **JSON** and **YAML**. JSON and YAML determine
  the types of data during parsing. For example, quotes indicate that a value is a
  string. Using Khi, programs determine the types of values themselves.
- This is a dictionary document.

```

### Element table example

This is a data storage example. It demonstrates that **Khi**, like **CSV**, natively
supports tables of values.

Notes:
 - This is a table document.
